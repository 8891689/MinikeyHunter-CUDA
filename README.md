# MinikeyHunter CUDA

# Project Overview

This is a high-performance mini-key Bitcoin address search tool that fully utilizes the powerful parallel computing capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs through CUDA technology. It is designed to find private keys corresponding to a given list of target Bitcoin addresses.


# How It Works

1. Initialization:
The program starts by reading an input file containing target Bitcoin addresses (in Base58 format).
These addresses and their corresponding HASH160 values are loaded into an in-memory std::set and two Bloom filters for fast lookups.
It initializes the secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography library and sets up the CUDA environment.

2. GPU Search Loop:
The program enters an infinite loop, processing one batch of keys per iteration.
In Sequential Mode: The current starting key (KEY_START_IX) is copied to the GPU.

3. In Random Mode: 

A random number generator is initialized on the GPU, or the search periodically jumps to a new random starting point.
The kernelMinikeys CUDA kernel is launched. Each GPU thread, based on a starting point or a random seed, generates and tests a large number of private keys. This kernel performs the elliptic curve multiplication to derive public keys, which is the most computationally expensive part of the process.
If a GPU thread finds a potential match (likely via a preliminary hash check), it flags it or stores it in an intermediate results buffer.

# Result Collection and CPU Verification:

The resultCollector kernel is launched to scan the intermediate buffer and gather all marked potential hits into a smaller, compact buffer.
This compact buffer is copied from the GPU back to the CPU.The CPU's thread pool (ctpl::thread_pool) receives these candidate private keys.

1. Each CPU thread executes the processCandidateThread function:
a. It calculates the full chain: Public Key -> HASH160 -> Base58 Address.
b. It checks the HASH160 against the filterR160 Bloom filter. If it's not a potential match, the candidate is discarded.
c. If it passes, it checks the Base58 address against the filter Bloom filter and discards it if not found.
d. If both filters pass, a final, precise lookup is performed in the std::set to confirm a true match (eliminating any Bloom filter false positives).
e. If a match is confirmed, the found address and its corresponding private key (in hex format) are printed to the console and saved to a result file.

2. Progress Update:

In sequential mode, the starting key (KEY_START_IX) is incremented after each batch is processed.
The program periodically displays the current computation speed (in MKey/s, GKey/s, or TKey/s) and the current key range being processed.
The saveStatus() function is called at regular intervals to write the progress to a file.

# How to Use

Compilation / Building
You will need the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit installed. Compile the project using the nvcc compiler:
```
make gpu=0 all
```
or
```
make gpu=0
```
Clean up and rebuild
```
make clean
```
# User Manual

1. Execution
```
./minikey -h
```
2. Command-Line Options:
```
-h, --help: Show this help message and exit.

-i <file>: (Required) Specify the input file containing target Bitcoin addresses (one per line).

-r: Enable Random Search Mode. If not specified, the default is sequential mode.

-s <start_key>: In sequential mode, specify a starting "Minikey" in Base58 format (e.g., -s S65iN5g6vbeT3pmnA1bFp6zT3).

-d <device_id>: Specify the GPU device ID to use (default is 0).

-b <blocks>: Set the number of CUDA blocks.

-t <threads>: Set the number of threads per CUDA block.
```
3. Examples:

4. Start a sequential search from a specific key, using GPU 0, preferably using the default dynamic allocation unless you have multiple graphics cards:
```
./minikey -i test.txt -d 0 -s S8888888888888888

./minikey -i test.txt -s S8888888888888888

5. Use GPU 1 for random search with custom number of blocks and threads, preferably with default dynamic allocation:
```
./minikey -i test.txt -r -d 1 -b 256 -t 512

./minikey -i test.txt -r

6. Execute from the beginning and you can experiment with it as a verification.

```
This is not a free project. You need to buy the public key extractor to get the password. You can also buy it separately for the same price. It is the same as the membership plan. You only pay a one-time fee, compressed password, the same as other project passwords.
